# Conclusion

In this project, we implemented a Java program to define a context-free grammar and convert it to a finite automaton. We also created functionality to generate valid strings from the language expressed by the given grammar, and to check whether a given input string can be obtained via state transition from the finite automaton.

# Background

We started by defining the components of a language:

Alphabet: Set of valid characters.
Vocabulary: Set of valid words.
Grammar: Set of rules/constraints over the language.
We then defined a context-free grammar using the set of non-terminals, terminals, and production rules. We used the following notation:

* VN={S, F, L}
* VT={a, b, c, d}
* P={S → bS
* S → aF
* S → d
* F → cF
* F → dF
* F → aL
* L → aL
* L → c
* F → b
}

# Implementation

We implemented a Grammar class with methods to generate valid strings and convert the grammar to a finite automaton. The class takes the following parameters:

A set of non-terminals
A set of terminals
A map of production rules
A starting non-terminal
We also implemented a FiniteAutomaton class with methods to check if a given input string belongs to the language expressed by the automaton. The class takes the following parameters:

A set of states
An alphabet
A transition function
A start state
A set of final states
Finally, we created a client class to instantiate the grammar and finite automaton classes, and tested the functionality of the program by generating valid strings and checking whether a given input string belongs to the language.

# Conclusion

We developed a Java software in this project to build a context-free grammar and transform it into a finite automaton. Moreover, we developed tools that allow users to evaluate whether a particular input string can be generated through a state transition from a finite automaton and to produce valid strings from the language described by a grammar.

The definition of a language's alphabet, vocabulary, and grammar came first. Next, utilizing the collection of non-terminals, terminals, and production rules, we developed a context-free grammar. Moreover, we provided methods to create legitimate strings and turn the grammar into a finite automaton, as well as built a class for the grammar.
We then defined a finite automaton using the set of states, alphabet, transition function, start state, and final states. We implemented a class for the finite automaton and added a method to check whether a given input string belongs to the language expressed by the automaton.

Finally, we created a client class to instantiate the grammar and finite automaton classes, and tested the functionality of the program by generating valid strings and checking whether a given input string belongs to the language.

The collection of states, alphabet, transition function, start state, and end states were then used to create a finite automaton. We created a class for the finite automata and added a method to determine whether an input text matches the language the automaton uses to express itself.

After creating a client class to instantiate the grammar and finite automaton classes, we evaluated the program's functioning by producing valid strings and determining if an input string matches the language.

Overall, this effort improved our understanding of formal languages, automata, and Java's ability to implement them. We discovered how to create a context-free grammar, transform it into a finite automaton, and add features to produce legitimate strings and and check whether a given input string belongs to the language.
